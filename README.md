# User-Interface-for-myFEUP-app

The user interface for "myFEUP" app was developed for the Human-Computer Interaction course, at Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.
It is a prototype created and tested by our classmates and students from FEUP.
We had multiple interations with the main purpose of perfectioning the interface
and make it more accesible for the future "users".

Here, you can view the prototype and test it: https://www.figma.com/file/HZvwraDTvIee12dZPcUCx7/Proj?node-id=0%3A1&t=QT4G8vmj7D5YdIG7-1
